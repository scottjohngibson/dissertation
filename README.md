Concept: 

This application has been designed to help you improve your DSLR photography skills and knowledge. Unlike other apps however,
ShutterBug aims to let you learn what you love, the way you love to do it! 

The core learning concept can be broken down into three high-level steps.

- First, you will use the app to emulate the camera settings and other photography conditions for the style of
  photography you want to improve.

- With your chosen settings, you are then ready to go out and take a picture(s) with your DSLR camera.

- After taking your picture(s), you return to ShutterBug to give feedback about your photography experience. 
  ShutterBug will then direct you to resources that are relevent to your interests, your strengths, and/or your
  learning opportunities.  



User Manual:    

ShutterBug is both a mobile/web based cross-platform application. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the cross-platform experience.

1) The "Genre Selection" page is the first page you will encounter. Here you will choose the style of photography - e.g. Portraiture,
   Landscape, Macro, Sports - you plan on carrying out. This ensures that all the following settings, visuals, and feedback are relevant
   to your interests. Currently only the "Portraiture" option is available. Select your style and continue!

2) Next is the "Simulation" page. Here you can adjust, and visualise, the effects of several camera settings. When you set up a picture
   you like, pop those settings into your own camera, and continue to the next page.

3) Now is the time to "Give Feedback"! ShutterBug will ask whether you are "happy with your photograph?". Choose either 'Yes' or 'No',
   and continue to the final page.

4) The "Get Feedback" page. Based on your chosen style, your settings, and whether you were happy with your photography experience - you
   will be given some advice, and directed to external resources that will improve your skills. Just click on an image and you're all
   set!
